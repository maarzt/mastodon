 * Renderer for a time-resliced graph overlay on a BDV.

 * In this class, spatial coordinates are stored in local variables named
 * <code>gPos</code> and <code>lPos</code> of type <code>double[]</code> with 3
 * elements:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>gPos</code> are world coordinates. It is used to store coordinates
 * in the global referential, that is the one with absolute, physical
 * coordinates. It is used <i>e.g.</i> to store vertex coordinates:
 * <code>vertex.localize(gPos)</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>lPos</code> are viewer coordinates. It is used to store coordinates
 * in the local referential, currently rendered in the BDV under a certain
 * orientation, zoom, etc. Mouse coordinates are typically stored in this
 * variable.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * TODO: Review and revise.
 *
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of model vertex.
 * @param <E>
 *            the type of model edge.
